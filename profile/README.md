## Open ENT 

This `open-ent` organization brings together repositories provided as open source by Edifice.io and the Open-Ent NG community.  

The goal is to contribute to the Open ENT project while maintaining certain specific features redistributed as open source:  
- Migration from JDK 8 to JDK 21  
- The ability to start an Open ENT instance directly in a development environment with hot code reloading  
- Integration of the launcher into a Quarkus application  

All contributions to the existing repositories comply with the AGPL license.  

This work would not have been possible without the financial support of:  
- The regions:  
  Hauts-de-France, Aquitaine  
- The departments:  
  Seine-et-Marne Department  
- The cities:  
  City of Paris Municipality  

and without the contributions of more than 50 developers from CGI, ATOS, Edifice.io, Worldline, and PASS-TECH.
